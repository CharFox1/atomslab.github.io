***Some Welcome text***

We are the **AI and Theory-Oriented Molecular Science (ATOMS)**, led by [Professor Tyler R. Josephson](https://cbee.umbc.edu/josephson/). We are part of the [Department of Chemical, Biochemical and Environmental Engineering](https://https://cbee.umbc.edu/) at the [University of Maryland Baltimore County](https://www.umbc.edu).



Research in our lab is focused on the uses and development of molecular simulation techniques and artificial intelligence tools to gain molecular-scale insights on processes in the environment to enable new solutions for cleaner air and water.
