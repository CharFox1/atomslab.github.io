As children get older, they acquire new facts, memories and skills, build and revise intuitive theories about people, objects, and space, and develop and foster social relationships with others. How does the brain support these remarkable achievements? Our lab uses a variety of methods, including child-friendly neuroimaging experiments, to address this question. In particular, we investigate the relationship between social cognitive development and brain development in childhood in order to inform theories of cognitive development and address basic science questions about the human brain.
