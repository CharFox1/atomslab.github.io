Note that at the moment, there have not been changes to UK participation in EU research programs, or in the eligibility of EU citizens to work at UK universities. Additionally, [the UK government has guaranteed to cover EU funding beyond Brexit](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-philip-hammond-guarantees-eu-funding-beyond-date-uk-leaves-the-eu).
