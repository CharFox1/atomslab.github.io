Note that at the moment, there have not been changes to UK participation in EU research programs, or in the eligibility of EU citizens to work at UK universities. Additionally, [the UK government has guaranteed to cover EU funding beyond Brexit](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-philip-hammond-guarantees-eu-funding-beyond-date-uk-leaves-the-eu).

##### Undergraduate Students/Research Assistants
If you are interested in volunteering or working as a research assistant, please email Hilary! The lab is currently working virtually, but there is a lot of exciting science that we can do even with these constraints. There are funding opportunities for undergraduate students interested in gaining research experience:
  * **[Carnegie Trust Vacation Scholarships](https://www.carnegie-trust.org/award-schemes/vacation-scholarships/)**
  * **[Wellcome Biomedical Vacation Scholarships](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/schemes/biomedical-vacation-scholarships)**
  * **[Nuffield Research Placements](https://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/students-teachers/nuffield-research-placements)**

The lab is currently working virtually, but if you are interested in "visiting" in some capacity, please email Hilary.
