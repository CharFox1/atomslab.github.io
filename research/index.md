# Our research
Our research addresses fundamental questions about cognitive development: what cognitive capacities are available early versus learned or developed gradually? To what extent is development domain-specific versus domain-general? What are the relative roles of genes and experience in individual differences and developmental change? To date, most of our research has tackled these questions with regards to children's developing <b><i>"theory of mind"</b></i> (ToM) - i.e., their intuitive theory for how mental states (beliefs, desires, emotions) interact and predict behavior.

We use a variety of methods, including child-friendly neuroimaging experiments. We ask:

#### When do we develop "specialized" brain regions for thinking about other minds?
Most research on the neural correlates of ToM reasoning has studied adults. Like many complex cognitive processes, ToM reasoning recruits multiple brain regions, including bilateral temporoparietal junction (TPJ), precuneus, and medial prefrontal cortex. In order to understand how the brain supports ToM development, our lab investigates the development of this cortical network in children. For example, we provide evidence that ToM brain regions act like a network and are evoked during ToM reasoning in children as young as three years old - who arenâ€™t yet very good at answering questions about beliefs that are false (Richardson et al., 2018).

#### What computations do "theory of mind" brain regions carry out, and how do responses in these regions change to support theory of mind development in childhood?
ToM brain regions become more functionally specialized throughout childhood - as children improve in ToM reasoning (Richardson et al., 2018; Richardson, 2019).

#### What environmental and genetic factors promote or hinder theory of mind development?
Specialization of the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ) in particular depends on early linguistic experience (Richardson et al., 2020).

#### Open Science
Our lab embraces open science practices. We share [data](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000228) and [stimuli](osf.io/spqgc) and are engaged in continual efforts to increase the transparency & replicability of our research.
