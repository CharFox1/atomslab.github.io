# Our research
Our research addresses fundamental questions about cognitive development: what cognitive capacities are available early versus learned or developed gradually? To what extent is development domain-specific versus domain-general? What are the relative roles of genes and experience in individual differences and developmental change? To date, most of our research has tackled these questions with regards to children's developing <b><i>"theory of mind"</i></b> (ToM) - i.e., their intuitive theory for how mental states (beliefs, desires, emotions) interact and predict behavior.

We use a variety of methods, including child-friendly neuroimaging experiments, to ask questions like: when do we develop "specialized" brain regions? What computations do these brain regions carry out? What kinds of neural changes support different aspects of cognitive development? What environmental and genetic factors promote or hinder development? 

#### Current projects


#### Open Science
Our lab embraces open science practices. We share [data](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000228) and [stimuli](https://osf.io/spqgc/), pre-register analysis plans, and are engaged in continual efforts to increase the transparency & replicability of our research.
